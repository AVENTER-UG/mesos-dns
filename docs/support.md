# Support for Mesos-DNS

Mesos-DNS is officially under development by the team at [Mesosphere](http://www.mesosphere.com). Since mesosphere stoped to support DC/OS, [AVENTER UG (haftungsbeschraenkt)](htts://www.aventer.biz) forked Mesos-DNS 
to ensure the future development. The team keeps an eye on issues and questions in a few places.

## Mesos-DNS Github Repository
